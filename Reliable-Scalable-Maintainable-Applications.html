            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              "The internet was done so well that most people think of it as a
              natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something
              that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a
              scale like that was so error-free?" - Alan Kay, Dr Dobb's Journal
              (2012)
            </p>
            <p>
              In today's technological landscape, many applications prioritize
              handling large amounts of data over intensive computation. As a
              result, raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these
              applications.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <article id="article">
          <p>
            However, the main challenges faced by these data-intensive
            applications are typically related to:
          </p>

          <li>
            Data Amount: Managing and processing large volumes of data
            efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Complexity: Dealing with the intricacies and diverse formats of
            the data.
          </li>
          <li>Data Velocity: Handling the speed at which data changes.</li>
          <p>
            Data-intensive applications are commonly built using standard
            building blocks that provide essential functionality. For example,
            these applications often require:
          </p>
          <li>
            Data storage capabilities through databases to ensure data
            availability when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Caches to store and retrieve frequently accessed data, enhancing
            read performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search indexes for enabling efficient data searching and filtering
            based on keywords and various criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stream processing systems to handle asynchronous message handling
            between processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Batch processing systems for periodically processing large volumes
            of accumulated data.
          </li>
          <p>
            These data systems have become successful abstractions that are
            widely used without much consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            When building an application, it is not necessary to reinvent the
            wheel by creating a new data storage engine from scratch. Databases
            serve as excellent tools for data storage and retrieval.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in the real world, things are not always so
            straightforward. There are numerous database applications with
            different characteristics and requirements. Various approaches to
            caching, search indexing, and more exist.
          </p>
          <h3>Thinking About Data Systems</h3>
          <p>
            We commonly categorize tools like databases, message queues, and
            caches as different entities. Although databases and message queues
            both store data, they have different access patterns, resulting in
            distinct performance characteristics and implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, recent years have witnessed the emergence of new tools for
            data storage that blur the boundaries between traditional
            categories. For example:
          </p>
          <li>
            There are data stores, like Redis, that are also utilized as message
            queues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Message queues like Kafka provide database-like durability
            guarantees.
          </li>
          <p>
            These tools are optimized for different use cases and no longer
            neatly fit into traditional categories. The lines between these
            categories are becoming increasingly blurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many modern applications have extensive and diverse requirements,
            making it challenging for a single tool to fulfill all data
            processing and storage needs. Consequently, work is broken down into
            tasks that can be efficiently performed by individual tools, and
            these different tools are stitched together using application code.
          </p>
          <p>For instance:</p>
          <li>
            An application may incorporate an application-managed caching layer
            using tools like Memcached or similar systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            It may also involve a separate full-text search server, such as
            Elasticsearch or Solr, alongside the main database.
          </li>
          <li>
            The responsibility of keeping caches and indexes in sync with the
            primary database often falls on the application code.
          </li>
          <li>
            When multiple tools are combined to provide a service, the service's
            interface or API typically hides the implementation details from
            clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            This integration of various tools creates a new special-purpose data
            system composed of smaller, general-purpose components.
          </li>
          <li>
            The composite data system may offer certain guarantees, such as
            correct cache invalidation or update propagation on writes, to
            ensure consistent results for external clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building such a system requires not only application development
            skills but also expertise in designing data systems.
          </li>
          <p>
            When designing a data system or service, several challenging
            questions arise, including:
          </p>
          <li>
            How can data remain correct and complete even when internal failures
            occur?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can consistent performance be provided to clients, even when
            certain parts of the system experience degradation?
          </li>
          <li>How can the system scale to handle increasing loads?</li>
          <li>What does an effective API for the service look like?</li>
          <p>
            The design of a data system is influenced by various factors, such
            as the skills and experience of the people involved, dependencies on
            legacy systems, the time scale for delivery, an organization's
            tolerance for different kinds of risks, regulatory constraints, and
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most software systems, three primary concerns hold significant
            importance:
          </p>
          <li>
            Reliability: The system should continue to function correctly,
            meeting desired performance levels, even in the face of adversity
            caused by hardware failures, software errors, or human mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scalability: As the system grows in terms of data volume, traffic,
            or complexity, there should be reasonable ways to handle that
            growth, ensuring the system's performance and availability are not
            compromised.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintainability: Over time, different individuals will work on the
            system, and they should be able to work on it productively,
            understanding and enhancing its functionality without introducing
            unnecessary complications.
          </li>
          <p>
            These terms—reliability, scalability, and maintainability—are
            commonly used, but it is crucial to have a clear understanding of
            what they truly mean and how to address them in the design and
            implementation of data-intensive applications.
